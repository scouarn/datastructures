# Data structure library

Collection of various handy cross-platform pieces of code about data manipulation implemented in C (ansi standard) with an homogeneous interface.

## What's done :

* error utility 
* linked list
* hashtable
* stack
* matrix

## TODO :

* redo lists...
* test static hashtable and put it in a different module / macros to switch between the two implementations

* queue
* dictionnary -- hashtable with string and no hash overlap
* arbitrary precision int
* strings
* threadpool
* tree
* common algorithms
* random numbers
* diff equations
* complexe numbers
* special functions
